#### BUGSüêõ
I personally doubt anybody will use this, but in the case that you ARE actually using this for something, and you run across a mischevious bug, feel free to submit an issue if you don't know how to fix it, and I'll tinker around until it's fixed, then push a new update and let you know in your original post before I mark it as completed. If you DO know how to fix it, please consider contributing to this project as I'd love to see what features/fixes we could potentially add in the future!
